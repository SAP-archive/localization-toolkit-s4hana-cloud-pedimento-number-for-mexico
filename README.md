## Localization Toolkit for SAP S/4HANA Cloud: Provide the Pedimento Number (Mexico) on e-Document using Custom Logic
This repository contains the sample code for the [Provide the Pedimento Number (Mexico) on e-Document using Custom Logic](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/09/15/provide-the-pedimento-number-mexico-on-e-document-using-custom-logic/) blog post.

*This code is only a part of the blog post, so please follow the blog post before attempting to use this code since it may also require other extensibility activities.*

### Description
*The blog post describes a sample business scenario to provide the Pedimento Number (Mexico legal requirement) on an e-document for sales invoice and explains how such an extension is possible on SAP S/4HANA Cloud.*

*A material imported into Mexico is given a Pedimento Number by the company, which is then given to its customers and tax authorities. Using the extensibility features of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you have the possibility to provide this Pedimento Number on the e-document for sales invoice for the authorities.*

*In the blog post example, we describe how to implement a custom logic using the Batch Management approach and then providing a Pedimento Number on the e-document.*
